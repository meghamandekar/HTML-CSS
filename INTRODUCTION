- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

- We can create a static website by HTML only.

- Technically, HTML is a Markup language rather than a programming language.

- HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

- A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 

- A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. 

Example:
<html>  
<head>  
<title>Web page title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1>Write Your First Heading</h1>  
<p>Write Your First Paragraph.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  


- <!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.

- <html > :This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document.

- <head>: It should be the first element inside the <html> element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). It must be closed before the body tag opens.

- <title>: As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. 


- <body> : This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.

- <h1> : Text between <h1> tag describes the first level heading of the webpage.

- <p> : Text between <p> tag describes the paragraph of the webpage.

# Building blocks of HTML

- Tags: An HTML tag surrounds the content and apply meaning to it. It is written between < and > brackets.

- Attribute: An attribute in HTML provides extra information about the element.

- Syntax
<tag name  attribute_name= " attr_value"> content </ tag name>   

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
  <head>  
    <title>The basic building blocks of HTML</title>  
 </head>  
  <body>  
       <h2>The building blocks</h2>  
       <p>This is a paragraph tag</p>  
       <p style="color: red">The style is attribute of paragraph tag</p>  
       <span>The element contains tag, attribute and content</span>  
  </body>  
</html>
